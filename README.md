# Substitute Soccer in Rust

This is Substitute Soccer from _Code the Classics Vol 1_, reimplemented in Rust with macroquad and hecs.

You will need the assets from the original repository (https://github.com/Wireframe-Magazine/Code-the-Classics/tree/master/soccer-master).

This is my first time using ECS and the functionality is essentially translated piece-by-piece from the original Python code so the structure is not as clean as it would be if written from scratch!
